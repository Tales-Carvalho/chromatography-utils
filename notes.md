# Notes

Chromatography -> separates each compound of a sample -> the task is to identify the amount of each compound

## RRF

RRF -> depends on # carbons, compound classification

compound classification -> depends on RT (peak distance of response time), based on data/database.csv

RT -> vem da distÃ¢ncia dos picos, baseado na tabela dos compostos (biblioteca) -> classifica o composto

RRF defines the library of the sample

## Compound classification

RT + Height + Area (from equipment result) -> determine compounds, based on closest RT + Area value in library

* find "highest close peak"

* start identifying alkanes and then fatty acids
